        Create a compelling cover letter for this job application.

        JOB ANALYSIS:
        {json.dumps(job_analysis, indent=2)}

        STRUCTURE:
        Paragraph 1 (Opening): Strong hook + excitement about the specific role/company.
        Paragraph 2 (The Match): Why this company? Connect their mission/needs to candidate's background.
        Paragraph 3 (The Proof): Highlight the most relevant achievement from the profile that solves a key problem they have.
        Paragraph 4 (Closing): Call to action, availability, and professional sign-off.

        CRITICAL RULES:
        1. Tone: Professional, confident, but grounded (not arrogant).
        2. Length: 250-350 words.
        3. Do NOT include placeholder addresses (header will be handled separately). Just the body.
        4. Use specific keywords from the job analysis.
        5. "Show, don't just tell" - use metrics from the profile.
